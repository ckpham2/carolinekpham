How might we design LivingRoom so that when people shop for furniture online, they can get recommendations for furniture according to the style of their space, visualize the furniture in there, and compare different models in order to get the best price and quality?</p>

What are some pain points and frustrations that the user encountered? And how can we improve upon the things they don’t like in the app?</p>
                  <p class="livingroom-text2">All of our users were able to successfully work through each task. However, they had some suggestions that we could improve upon. For instance, one users suggested back buttons for the user survey portion. Another user recommended clarity in how one might enter room dimensions manually. Upon checkout, one user would have liked to see a review order tab on the final checkout page.</p>
                  <p class="livingroom-text2">Overall, users liked how much guidance they were given. They also liked seeing progress bars when there were several tasks asked of them.</p>

                <p class="livingroom-text2">Designing with the user in mind is something I learned the most in the exploration. Keeping in mind the considerations for design that people who may not be familiar with AR technology. While it was challenging, but it allowed us to make more informed design decisions on what helped the user and what did not. This was also one of the first projects I worked on that made me go through the entire UX process from ideation, user research, market analysis, visuals all the way to protoyping. In essence, it allowed me to fully test my UX design process and how to execute it in a timeline while collaborating with designers on my team.</p>
