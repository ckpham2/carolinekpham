After conducting our interviews and survey, we synthesized our data into affinity diagrams in order to pin point our users’ needs, goals and frustrations, We found that many users felt frustrated if the information was outdated, many pages or links are dead end. Users also provided insights to what they wished to see on a nonprofit website as well as being able to easily navigate and find how they can donate, volunteer, background on the non-profit and who the nonprofit helps. We also conducted a competitor analysis against a few of our direct and indirect competitors to gain further insight on the users’ through process.</p>

                      <br>
                    1. Busy Imagery

                <p class="livingroom-text2">Our team’s goal was to determine whether Patriots & Paws website functions as intended while being easy for users to navigate through. We asked our users to complete 3 tasks, as illustrated above. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    All of our users were able to successfully work through each task. However, they had some suggestions that we could improve upon on our website design & navigation. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  1. Call to visibility to important buttons for better noticeability.
                  <br>
                  2. Rename certain tabs for clearer navigation. (Ex: Ways to Give)
                  <br>
                  3. Relocate some of the buttons. (Ex: “Donate Now” towards the top of the page more for easier finding). 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Overall, users liked how easy it was for them to navigate along with the information being clear and straightforward on each page. They found the donate button on every page to be helpful in making it quick and easy to donate without having to go back to the Donation page.

                    Once we completed our user testing on the lo-fidelity prototype, we designed a Style Guide for our High Fidelity Prototype. In creating our prototype we made sure to use and follow a 4pt grid with 20px gutter/20px margin for our mobile version & a 12pt grid with 20px gutter/93px marging for our web version.

        <div class="casestudy-body">
            <p class="livingroom-text2">Through our design process, we learn the importance of how words and they way things are worded on certain pages contribute to the user’s experience of being able to easily navigate and find information they are looking for. In order for us to provide the best user experience and keep users’ attention, iterating was key to ensure a seemless design and navigation experience as well through A/B testing to learn the best design users were receptive to.
                <br>
                <br>
                Our plan for the future is to futher improve our design and the user’s experience by continuing to develop the web version by further develop the navigation bar, create other pages (FAQ, Contact Us, etc.), while also adding testimonials by gathering quotes, photos, etc. from families & military personnel that have successfully been helped through Patriots & Paws. We plan to also gather testimonials from staff and volunteer that have contributed to helping veterans, active duty military personnel and reservists at Patriots & Paws.
