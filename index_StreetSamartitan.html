                  <h3 class="street-heading">The Problem</h3>
                  <p class="street-text3">The homelessness crisis rates steadily grow each year. In Los Angeles alone, more than 60,000 people are living on the streets. 
                      <br>
                      <br>
                    Research has shown that the general public is often hindered from donating to the homeless, citing factors such as a fear of the funds being used negatively, their own safety, and the lack of compassion between the homeless and the community. How could we provide a platform that highlights the stories of people experiencing homelessness while offering transparent and effective methods of donating, with the ultimate goal of improving the living standards of the homeless?
                    </p>
              </div>
              <div class="casestudy-body">
                  <h3 class="street-heading">The Solution</h3>
                  <p class="street-text3">We believe that users will feel more inclined to help & donate to the homeless community if each individual was introduced on a more personal basis. By creating an online social platform for the homeless, Street Samaritan hopes to share their stories and life meaningfully and allow users to donate with peace of mind.

From there we divided our findings to an affinity diagram, the highlights of our data showed that most people were concerned about the transparency of donation, also that  donating habits ranged from giving change on the street to more secure donations done through trustworthy campaigns or organizations they found on social media sites.</p>

Meet Henry, our donatee who has been experiencing homelessness after losing his job. Henry is in need of resources to support his daily life. He is willing to accept any generosity that reaches out to him but is frustrated because stigma against the homeless community makes it difficult for people to help. We create a 2nd persona to show what kind of individuals can benefit on the opposite end of our app.</p>

                <p class="street-text2">To help start our ideation process, we wanted to explore similar programs that dealt with homelessness and/or donations, through analyzing our competitors, Handup and Gofundme.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We found that Handup’s - strong points is that they have verified member profiles and transparent donations.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Gofundme - gives users freedom in creating fundraisers consistently updated by a large and supportive community.

                    <br>

            <br>
            <br>
            Let’s take a look at a day in the life of Sharon. As the storyboard illustrates below, Sharon is on her way to work getting through the commute rush, and she sees  a homeless person with a sign on the street. She debates if she should help, but she decides not to in worry of her safety and not being late to work. Sharon later is unable to take her mind off the homeless person she passed and how she could have helped. In looking for a modern solution, she comes across STREET SAMARITAN. She downloads the app and based on her location she concidentally comes across Henry, the homeless person she passed earlier. She is now happy she is able to donate to Henry and others in need through a safe and secure way.

                <p class="street-text2">Our key takeways from this project is that empathy is at the core of every project, as our app is revolved around touching people’s empathy and compassion to encourage people to help and connect with the homeless through donating. We also learned the importance of staying focused on the project’s main vision, as we were brainstorming our app’s design and features, there were a lot of ideas and features we wanted to include, but we realized a lot of the things we wanted to include detracted from Street Samaritan’s main vision. Thus, we had to weed out between the necessary features and features that we considered more of a luxury.</p>
